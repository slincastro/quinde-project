**🧠 Explicación:**

The provided Prolog code for calculating the Fibonacci sequence contains a few errors. The base cases for Fibonacci are correct, but the recursive case has mistakes. Specifically, the recursive calls should compute the Fibonacci numbers for N1 and N2, not twice for N1. Additionally, the final computation of F should sum F1 and F2, not F1 twice. The corrected code fixes these issues by ensuring the recursive calls are made correctly and the final sum is computed properly.

**💻 Código:**

```prolog
% Corrected Prolog code for Fibonacci sequence

fibonacci(0, 0). % Corrected base case for fibonacci(0)
fibonacci(1, 1).
fibonacci(N, F) :-
    N > 1,
    N1 is N - 1,
    N2 is N - 2,
    fibonacci(N1, F1),
    fibonacci(N2, F2),  
    F is F1 + F2.       

% Example usage:
% To find the 5th Fibonacci number, you can query:
% ?- fibonacci(5, F).
% F = 5.

% To find the 10th Fibonacci number, you can query:
% ?- fibonacci(10, F).
% F = 55.

**🧠 Explicación:**

The provided Prolog code for calculating the Fibonacci sequence contains a few errors. The base cases for Fibonacci are incorrect for the 0th term, and the recursive case has mistakes. Specifically, the recursive calls should compute the Fibonacci numbers for N1 and N2, not twice for N1. Additionally, the final computation of F should sum F1 and F2, not F1 twice. The corrected code fixes these issues by ensuring the recursive calls are made correctly and the final sum is computed properly. Also, the base case for fibonacci(0) should return 0, not 1.
