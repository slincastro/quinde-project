These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using it), reasoning (using these rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction. Some of the key subfields of AI include:\\n\\n1. **Machine Learning:** A method of data analysis that automates analytical model building, allowing computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.\\n\\n2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** The ability of an AI to understand and interact using human language, enabling applications like chatbots and language translation.\\n\\n3. **Robotics:** The design and creation of robots that can perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously.\\n\\n4. **Vision:** Also known as computer vision, this enables machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual data from the world.\\n\\n5. **Expert Systems:** These are AI systems designed to solve complex problems by reasoning through bodies of knowledge, represented mainly as if-then rules.\\n\\nAI can be categorized into two types:\\n\\n- **Narrow AI (Weak AI):** This type of AI is designed and trained for a specific task such as voice recognition or image processing.\\n\\n- **General AI (Strong AI):** This is a form of AI with the ability to understand, learn, and apply intelligence flexibly across a wide range of tasks, much like a human. However, achieving strong AI is still largely a theoretical endeavor and remains a future goal within the field.\\n\\nAI has applications in various sectors, including healthcare, finance, autonomous vehicles, customer service, and more, contributing to efficiency, innovation, and new capabilities across industries.', refusal=None, role='assistant', annotations=[], audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1742343013, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', service_tier='default', system_fingerprint='fp_6ec83003ad', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=340, prompt_tokens=11, total_tokens=351, completion_tokens_details=CompletionTokensDetails(accepted_prediction_tokens=0, audio_tokens=0, reasoning_tokens=0, rejected_prediction_tokens=0), prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetails(audio_tokens=0, cached_tokens=0)))\n"
